CHANGES
=======

0.1 (2012-04-15)
----------------

* The slot rendering is now secured. If `zope.security` is present,
  the TALES will check the permission, to allow or not the slot rendering.
  Please not that this change only if you use secured slot. If not, the
  change will be effectless.
* `dolmen.tales.slot` now respects the `ISlot` interface  and will no
  long call `__call__` but will now use successively `update` and `render`
  as it normally should.


0.1a1 (2011-05-09)
------------------

* Initial release
